            <h2>An introduction to Web Page Design and Search Engines</h2>
            <h2>What is Web Page Design?</h2>
            <p>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website. Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website. Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web designer’s output is a site that wins and fosters the trust of the target audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration.</p>
            <h2>For more information on Web-Design refer to the following video... What is a Search Engine?</h2>
            <p>A search engine is a software program that helps people find the information they are looking for online using keywords or phrases.Search engines are able to return results quickly—even with millions of websites online—by scanning the Internet continuously and indexing every page they find.When a user enters a search term, the search engine looks at the website page titles, contents and keywords it has indexed and uses algorithms (step-by-step operations) to produce a list of sites—with the most relevant websites at the top of the list.Companies use search engine optimization(SEO) to help search engines recognize their websites as highly relevant to particular searches. Popular search engines include Google, Bing and Yahoo.</p>
            <h2>Some Designing Principles to keep in mind when you are designing a web-page...</h2>
            <h3>(1) Website Purpose:</h3>
            <p>Your website needs to accommodate the needs of the user. Having a simple clear intention on all pages will help the user interact with what you have to offer. What is the purpose of your website? Are you imparting practical information like a ‘How to guide’? Is it an entertainment website like sports coverage or are you selling a product to the user? There are many different purposes that websites may have but there are core purposes common to all websites:</p>

                <p>Describing Expertise</p>
                
                <p>Building your reputation</p>
                
                <p>Generating leads</p>
                
                <p>Sales and after care</p>
            <h3>(2) Simplicity:</h3>
            <p>Simplicity is the best way to go when considering the user experience and the usability of your website. Below are ways to achieve simplicity through design.</p>
            <h3>(3) Navigation:</h3>
            <p>Navigation is the wayfinding system used on websites where visitors interact and find what they are looking for. Website navigation is key to retaining visitors. If the website navigation is confusing visitors will give up and find what they need elsewhere. Keeping navigation simple, intuitive and consistent on every page is key.</p>
            <h3>(4) Visual Hierarchy:</h3>
            <p>Visual hierarchy is the arrangement of elements in order of importance. This is done either by size, colour, imagery, contrast, typography, whitespace, texture and style. One of the most important functions of visual hierarchy is to establish a focal point; this shows visitors where the most important information is.</p>
            <h3>(5) Content:</h3>
            <p>An effective website has both great design and great content. Using compelling language great content can attract and influence visitors by converting them into customers.</p>
            <h3>(6) Grid Based Layout:</h3>
            <p>Grids help to structure your design and keep your content organised. The grid helps to align elements on the page and keep it clean. The grid-based layout arranges content into a clean rigid grid structure with columns, sections that line up and feel balanced and impose order and results in an aesthetically pleasing website.</p>
            <h3>(7) Load Time:</h3>
            <p>Waiting for a website to load will lose visitors. Nearly half of web visitors expect a site to load in 2 seconds or less and they will potentially leave a site that isn’t loaded within 3 seconds. Optimising image sizes will help load your site faster.</p>
            <h3>(8) Mobile Friendly:</h3>
            <p>More people are using their phones or other devices to browse the web. It is important to consider building your website with a responsive layout where your website can adjust to different screens.</p>
            <h2>What are Search Engines?</h2>
            <p>Search engine is a service that allows Internet users to search for content via the World Wide Web (WWW). A user enters keywords or key phrases into a search engine and receives a list of Web content results in the form of websites, images, videos or other online data that semantically match with the search query. The list of content returned via a search engine to a user is known as a search engine results page (SERP).</p>
            <h2>How Search Engines work?</h2>
            <p>A search engine performs a number of steps to do its job. First a spider/web crawler trawls the web for content that is added to the search engine's index. These small bots can scan all sections and subpages of a website, including content such as video and images.</p>
            <p>Hyperlinks are parsed to find internal pages or new sources to crawl when they point to external websites. To help bots do their crawling work in a more efficient way, larger websites usually submit a special XML sitemap to the search engine that acts as a roadmap of the site itself.</p>
            <p>Once all data has been fetched by the bots, the crawler adds it to a massive online library of all discovered URLs. This constant and recursive process is known as indexing, and is necessary for a website to be displayed in the SERP. Then, when a user queries a search engine, relevant results are returned based on the search engine's algorithm.</p>
            <p>The higher a website is ranked in the SERP, the more relevant it should be to the searcher’s query. Since most users only browse the top results, it is particularly important for a website to rank high enough for certain queries to ensure its success in terms of traffic.</p>
            <p>A whole science developed in the last few decades to make sure that a website, or at least some of its pages, “scale” the ranking to reach the first positions. This discipline is known as Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</p>
            <h2>Types of Search Engines</h2>
            <p>Search engines are classified into the following three categories based on how it works.</p>
                <p>Crawler Based Search Engines</p>
                
                <p>Human Powered Directories</p>
                
                <p>Hybrid Search Engines</p>
                
                <p>Other Special Search Engines</p>
